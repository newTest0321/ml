**An end-to-end Machine Learning engineering project that demonstrates how an ML system evolves from experimentation into a production-ready, containerized, and deployable service.**

</div>



## 🎯 Project Overview

This repository demonstrates the **full lifecycle of a Machine Learning system**, from early experimentation to production-oriented deployment.

Using the **California Housing dataset**, the project focuses on **engineering practices**:

- Reproducible training pipelines
- Explicit separation between training and serving
- Model lifecycle management with MLflow
- Batch and online inference workflows
- Docker-first execution
- Kubernetes-ready architecture



## 🌿 Branch Architecture

This repository is structured as a **progressive learning path**, with each branch representing a stage in ML system maturity.

| Branch | Focus | Key Question |
|------|------|-------------|
| `ml-baseline` | ML experimentation | *How do we explore data and choose a model?* |
| `api-baseline` | Serving fundamentals | *How do we expose a trained model?* |
| `main` | Production MLOps | *How does this become reliable and deployable?* |

The `main` branch represents the **final, production-oriented design**.



## 🏗️ System Architecture Overview

```mermaid

    subgraph "Data Layer"
        A[Raw Data<br/>data/raw/housing.csv] --> B[DVC Versioning]
    end
    
    subgraph "Training Pipeline"
        C[Training Script<br/>pipelines/train.py] --> D[MLflow Tracking]
        D --> E[Model Registry<br/>CaliforniaHousingRegressor]
        D --> F[S3 Artifact Store<br/>Model Artifacts + Code]
    end
    
    subgraph "Inference Layer"
        G[Batch Inference<br/>pipelines/inference.py]
        H[KServe InferenceService<br/>MLServer Runtime]
        F --> G
        F --> H
        E --> G
    end
    
    subgraph "Serving Architecture"
        I[KServe V2 Protocol<br/>Tensor-based Requests]
        J[MLflow PyFunc Model<br/>Preprocessing + Model]
        H --> I
        I --> J
    end
    
    A --> C
    B --> C
```

**Key Architecture Decisions:**
- **Model Serving**: KServe with MLServer runtime (V2 protocol only)
- **Model Packaging**: MLflow PyFunc with bundled preprocessing
- **Artifact Storage**: S3 for model artifacts, MLflow Registry for versioning
- **Code Packaging**: Absolute imports with `src/` as Python package
